# Discord Custom Rich Presence with Rust and Tauri GUI

## TODO
### High priority
- [] Complete GUI
- [] 
### Medium Priority
- [] Allow custom discord app ids to be entered to allow custom images and stuff
- [] Tray minimisation stuff
### Low priority
- [] Manage all errors instead of just unwrap() -ing everything like a bozo
- [] text has to be atleast 2 characters (2 spaces works) for it to update. Have it check for this and add spaces to make sure it hits this req
- [] large/small image has to be accompanied by large/small text or it wont update. Have it also check for this and add spaces if needed (Need to test this again)
